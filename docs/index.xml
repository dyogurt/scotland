      <description>The Slow Ways is a project that aims to map out all foothpaths across Great Britain.
The mapping is being done this year by thousands of volunteers — check how to become one — and includes locating and confriming paths across towns and villages.
The main goal is to make paths more visible and accessible online and for free — showing people safe ways to walk short or long distances.</description>

Inside you can find plants from all over the world, outside, Botanical Gardens and the River Kelvin.
Maybe Charon will be nearby and help you cross it :)</description>
