The [Slow Ways](https://slowways.uk/) is a project that aims to map out all foothpaths across Great Britain.

The mapping is being done this year by thousands of volunteers — check how to [become one](https://slowways.uk/) — and includes locating and confriming paths across towns and villages.

The main goal is to make paths more visible and accessible online and  for free — showing people safe ways to walk short or long distances.
