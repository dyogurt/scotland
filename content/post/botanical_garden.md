Not far from you there is a delicate glass dome that covers another world in moist air and soft sunshineâ€”[The Kibble Palace](https://www.glasgowbotanicgardens.com/the-gardens/history/kibble-palace/).

Inside you can find plants from all over the world, outside, Botanical Gardens and the River Kelvin.

Maybe Charon will be nearby and help you cross it :)
